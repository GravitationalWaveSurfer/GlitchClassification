# GlitchClassification

This project's goal is to classify glitches found in Virgo gravitational wave data. Utilizing advanced data processing and machine learning techniques, it aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of gravitational wave data analysis.

## Contents

The repository is organized in two folders for useful **scripts** and demos **notebooks**. The **notebook** folder contains:

- **sample_worker**: This directory contains scripts and utilities designed to automate data processing tasks. The sample worker simplifies the execution of repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency and efficiency in data analysis.

- **wdf_demo**: Here, you will find a demonstration of the project's capabilities using the full Waveform Data Format (WDF). The demo includes detailed instructions on setup, execution, and result interpretation, providing a hands-on experience with gravitational wave data classification.

The **scripts** folder contains scripts to load a sample segment list for analysis. Other files in the repo are:

- **.gitignore**: This file lists directories and files that are intentionally untracked by Git to prevent them from being included in the repository. It's been updated recently to keep the repository clean from system files and dependencies.

- **Dec23_ER-DQstudies_seg.csv**: CSV file with a list of Advanced Virgo interferometer segment times. 

## Installation & Requirements

You can clone the repository to your local machine. However, you will have to install the WDF library in your environment. To do this visit the [WDF project page](https://gitlab.com/wdfpipe/wdf/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads) and follow the installation instructions provided there.

## Usage

Refer to the notebook directory and its content (`sample_worker` and `wdf_demo`) for guided instructions on running WDF.
